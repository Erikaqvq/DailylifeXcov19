1. Project Title：
Daily life with COVID-19

2.Project Summary:
Daily life with COVID-19 will be a comprehensive database of COVID-19 information. It is divided into three major sections. The first is COVID-19 basic data, such as the number of confirmed diagnoses, cures, deaths, and vaccinations in each country. The second is COVID-19-related news and rumors, as well as social media discussions about it. The third step is to forecast the outbreak's trend in each region, which will rely on data analysis models.

The attractive feature of our database is that we work closer to reality than authoritative databases such as the WHO. People prefer to focus solely on the most basic information regarding COVID-19 when it comes to data. People want to see news and comments at the same time. And trend forecasting can help consumers make smarter travel plans. As a result, our database wishes to merge these aspects.

3. Description:
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory illness that can be passed from person to person. Although attitudes and responses vary by country, we cannot deny that this virus will be with us for a long time. Furthermore, news and discussions on social media influence our personal perspectives on COVID-19. Large and detailed professional data is presented among the existing well-known databases, such as WHO. However, we do not always care about information that is too far removed from our lives. We want a comprehensive tool that includes not only basic COVID-19 data, but also news, fake news, and social media discussions. We would also like to see predictions about the future development of the epidemic in a specific location in order to make travel plans.

4. Usefulness:
First and foremost, our database provides a good knowledge of the fundamentals of COVID-19. Knowing the current virus infection symptoms and infection rates around you might help you effectively prevent illness. Our database is useful since it provides a wide range of information and allows you to examine both official facts and what people are talking about.

The COVID-19 database of the WHO was the source of our original concept. However, even though it was presented in a number of colorful charts, we found it very boring to browse through its pages and struggled to find the information we were looking for. We can only see the datas like the numbers of confirmed, the numbers of death, which is not so useful in daily life. In our program, it will be easy to show the situation of COVID-19 searching by regions and time, including the basic data, the policies in that region and social media discussion. According to those data, we can generate a prediction of the future situation of COVID-19 and provide epidemic prevention advice which is more useful in daily life.

5. Realness:
It is relatively simple to find relevant data for each of our boards. Basic information such as the number of confirmed diagnoses, for example, can be obtained directly from the WHO database. Many well-known journals, such as Lancet, Nature, and Science, have separate sections for COVID-19 news and research results, making our data collection easier. We can also get information about social media discussions on Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms. If possible, we will select different social media from different countries to make our work more comprehensive.

6. Functionality:
What data is stored in the database?
COVID-19 basic data (confirmed diagnoses, cures, deaths, vaccinations by country), news, rumors, social media discussions, model predictions of outbreak trends by region.

What are the basic functions of your web application?
Users can browse COVID-19 data by country and region, as well as filter by time, region, virus type, response policy, and other criteria. Users can also use keywords to filter papers, news, and social media discussions, such as virus type, symptoms, and region.

What would be a good creative component (function) that can improve the functionality of your application?
Users can choose regions and times to see the outbreak development predicted by the model, as well as the model's accuracy based on past data. We will combine some of the latest research results to select a suitable model.
