## Project Summary

Daily life with COVID-19 will be a comprehensive database of COVID-19 information. It is divided into three major sections. The first is COVID-19 basic data, such as the number of confirmed diagnoses, cures, deaths, and vaccinations in each country. The second is COVID-19-related news and rumors, as well as social media discussions about it. The third step is to forecast the outbreak's trend in each region, which will rely on data analysis models.

The attractive feature of our database is that we work closer to reality than authoritative databases such as the WHO. People prefer to focus solely on the most basic information regarding COVID-19 when it comes to data. People want to see news and comments at the same time. And trend forecasting can help consumers make smarter travel plans. As a result, our database wishes to merge these aspects.
